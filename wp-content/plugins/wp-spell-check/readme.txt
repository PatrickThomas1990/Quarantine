**This plugin is LIGHTS OUT!!!!!**

This is one amazing product. I have a web site that has over 8000 pages.
You can imagine the load it would take to review each page.
This plugin is LIGHTS OUT!!!!!
Five stars, saved me a thousand hours.
What is better than the plugin is the support.
Every time I have an issue they were right there to help, and they worked feverishly to fix and restore.
I have NEVER worked with a company that had back-end support.
I can't brag about them enough.
Thank you so much guys, you rock and I would highly recommend you to everyone.
You helped me more than you will know

By Michael Sullivan, USA

I have been looking for a plugin that could spellcheck an entire website for common misspellings and this plugin does just that. You can download the trial version to test it out on your site for page content and post titles. If you want more features, then you should buy the pro version.

By socreatives

**Works Perfectly Amazing**

It helped us to find a lot of hidden content on the site that was hurting us with **SEO**. A lot of lorem ipsum here and there and multi-language details we didn't see. The template had many small things which we didn't use and they are all discovered. I like this plugin a lot. Thank you
Ali Tavanayan, Vancouver

**Truly a great plugin**

Truly a great plugin **for the developer** who does not write the content but is nevertheless responsible for proper spellings! Misspelled words create an image of poor design



**Presentation is everything!**

Other than broken links, misspelled words create an image of poor design. WP Spell Check helps our team maintain a professional web presence.

Adam Halpern, Houston, USA



**Worked Great for me**

I emailed the support team about 1 small bug I found, and they fixed it immediately, thanked me, and followed up. Couldn't be happier. I didn't realize how many spelling mistakes my site had till I ran these scans. Thanks!!
